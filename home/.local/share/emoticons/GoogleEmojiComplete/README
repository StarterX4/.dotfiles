For a mysterious reason, selecting the new theme in System Settings
causes changes in some emoticons, that don't work. So, to prevent
this issue, after installing the theme and before enabling it go in

$HOME/.kde/share/emoticons/Google*

or

$HOME/.kde4/share/emoticons/Google*

(depending on your distro) and change attributes of emoticons.xml
removing write permission.

If you miss this step and you notice strange characters on chat log,
I have included a backup file of the theme file that you can use to
restore defaults and adjust permissions.
