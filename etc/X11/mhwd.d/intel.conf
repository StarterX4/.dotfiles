	Option	    "TearFree" "True"
	Option	    "VSync"   "True"
#This option controls the use of commands to synchronise rendering with the vertical refresh of the display. Some rendering commands have the option to be performed in a "tear-free" fashion by stalling the GPU to wait for the display to be outside of the region to be updated. This slows down all rendering, and historically has been the source of many GPU hangs. 
	Option 	    "TripleBuffer" "True"
#This option enables the use of a third buffer for page-flipping. The third buffer allows applications to run at vrefresh rates even if they occasionally fail to swapbuffers on time. The effect of such missed swaps is the output jitters between 60fps and 30fps, and in the worst case appears frame-locked to 30fps. The disadvantage of triple buffering is that there is an extra frame of latency, due to the pre-rendered frame sitting in the swap queue, between input and any display update.
